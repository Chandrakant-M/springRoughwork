Configure java object in an xml file( eg. employeeBean.xml or web.xml):
  create an xml file in (? where does the container search for xml files) with root tag beans(with properties xmlns,xmlcontext and 
    schemalocation). Child tag(s) bean with sub-tags property which defines what will be the properties of object that will be created.
  Use spring IOC container (BeanFactory or ApplicationContext) to get the objects constructed by them.
    ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("employeeBean.xml")
    Employee emp1 = (Employee) context.getBean("emp1"); // emp1 is the id attribute of the bean tag defined in the xml file; other attribute
      // being class which states the class of the object being created. Property sub-tag has properties name and value.
      // --> emp1 object created will have the properties taken from the xml file
    Employee emp2 = context.getBean("emp2",Employee.class);
